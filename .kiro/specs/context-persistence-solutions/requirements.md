# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements two distinct persistence solutions for context engineering to enable long-term memory and contextual awareness in AI applications. The first solution leverages LangChain's memory management capabilities with vector storage for semantic retrieval, while the second solution uses Neo4j as a graph database running in a local Docker container to store and query contextual relationships. Both solutions will provide complementary approaches to context persistence - one optimized for semantic similarity search and another for relationship-based queries and graph traversal.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement LangChain-based context persistence, so that I can store and retrieve conversational context using semantic similarity search.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL create an InMemoryVectorStore with OpenAI embeddings for storing context memories
2. WHEN a user interaction occurs THEN the system SHALL save relevant context as embeddings in the vector store with user ID metadata
3. WHEN retrieving context THEN the system SHALL perform semantic similarity search filtered by user ID
4. WHEN context is retrieved THEN the system SHALL return the top 3 most relevant memories based on similarity scores
5. IF a user session exists THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation history using RunnableWithMessageHistory
6. WHEN storing memories THEN the system SHALL include structured metadata including user_id, timestamp, and memory type

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement Neo4j graph-based context persistence, so that I can store and query contextual relationships through graph traversal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL initialize a Neo4j Docker container with persistent volume mounting
2. WHEN storing context THEN the system SHALL create nodes representing entities, concepts, and relationships
3. WHEN querying context THEN the system SHALL use Cypher queries to traverse relationships and find connected information
4. WHEN a user interaction occurs THEN the system SHALL create or update graph nodes with contextual relationships
5. IF related entities exist THEN the system SHALL establish appropriate relationships between nodes
6. WHEN retrieving context THEN the system SHALL return graph paths showing contextual connections
7. WHEN the container restarts THEN the system SHALL persist all graph data through mounted volumes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want both persistence solutions to work independently, so that I can compare their effectiveness for different use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing both solutions THEN each system SHALL operate independently without dependencies
2. WHEN storing context THEN each system SHALL use its own data format and storage mechanism
3. WHEN querying context THEN each system SHALL provide results using its native query capabilities
4. IF one system fails THEN the other system SHALL continue to operate normally
5. WHEN testing THEN the system SHALL provide separate interfaces for each persistence solution
6. WHEN comparing results THEN the system SHALL allow querying both systems with the same input

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure and manage both persistence solutions, so that I can control their behavior and monitor their performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring LangChain persistence THEN the system SHALL allow setting vector store parameters and embedding models
2. WHEN configuring Neo4j persistence THEN the system SHALL provide Docker container configuration options
3. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL validate that all required dependencies are available
4. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fail gracefully
5. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL log query times and storage metrics for both solutions
6. WHEN managing data THEN the system SHALL provide methods to clear, backup, and restore data for both systems

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to evaluate both persistence solutions using LangChain's latest evaluation framework, so that I can measure their effectiveness with standardized metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing evaluation THEN the system SHALL use LangChain's evaluation tools including context_recall and relevance metrics
2. WHEN testing context retrieval THEN the system SHALL measure context recall accuracy for both persistence solutions
3. WHEN evaluating responses THEN the system SHALL assess answer relevance and groundedness using LangChain evaluators
4. WHEN running evaluations THEN the system SHALL generate comparative scores between vector and graph-based retrieval
5. IF evaluation results differ THEN the system SHALL provide detailed analysis of performance variations
6. WHEN evaluation completes THEN the system SHALL output structured evaluation reports with metrics and recommendations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to start with an MVP implementation, so that I can build and test the core functionality before adding complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting development THEN the system SHALL prioritize the LangChain vector-based solution as the primary implementation
2. WHEN implementing the MVP THEN the system SHALL focus on basic memory storage and retrieval functionality
3. WHEN adding Neo4j support THEN the system SHALL implement it as a secondary, optional persistence layer
4. IF the basic implementation works THEN the system SHALL allow incremental addition of advanced features
5. WHEN testing the MVP THEN the system SHALL validate core functionality with simple test cases
6. WHEN the MVP is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a foundation for extending to full feature set
